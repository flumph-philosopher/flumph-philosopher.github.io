The Rifleman class gets less attacks per round than the [Pistolero][1] (2 vs 4 at level 4).
To make up for this a Rifleman can deal greater damage per shot, and can do it from farther away.

With template D they gain the ability to perform a [SWN][3] style execution attack, as well as the ability to perform all sorts of firearm trickery with **Impossible Shot**.


### Rifleman

A Rifleman starts with a hunting breechloader, 25 small calibre bullets, a leather vest, and a brass pocket watch.
| A) | Expert Shot, Steady Hand |
| B) | Covering Fire, Rifle Expert |
| C) | Who Shot Me?, Sharp Eye, +1 attack |
| D) | Headshot, Impossible Shot |

* **Expert Shot**

    Place your bullet exactly where you want.
    If you beat a to-hit roll by 6 or more, you may decide to impose one of the following effects instead of rolling damage.

    **Blind:** Target will have the **Blind** condition for one round.  
    **Confuse:** Target will have a 2 in 6 chance of attacking it's own allies next round, and a 2 in 6 chance of doing nothing.  
    **Cripple:** Drop the target's movement rate to zero for one round.  
    **Disarm:** Knock an object out of the target's hands.  
    **Frighten:** Target will spend it's movement next round trying to retreat from you.  

* **Steady Hand**

    Double the listed effective range for all firearms.
    
* **Covering Fire**

    Use one bullet per target HD, up to 6 HD, to spend the round distracting the enemy.
    All the target's actions will recieve a -4 penalty for the next round.
    No roll necessary.

* **Rifle Expert**

    All damage dice you roll for long guns now explode on ones and max.
    Additionally you may now add your level to damage with rifles.

* **Who Shot Me?**

    Enemies now only have a 1 in 12 chance of spotting you when you are at least 100 feet away,
    and are firing from a sufficiently well hidden location
    (5 feet back from a dark window, crouched behind a parapet on a roof, on a hillside in a ghillie suit, etc.).
    Chance to spot you increases by 1 for every additional round you fire.

* **Sharp Eye**

    Tripple the listed effective range for all firearms.

* **Headshot**

    You spend 1 minute taking aim at an unsuspecting target.
    If you are spotted, the target moves out of sight, or the target becomes alerted that they may be in danger, the **Headshot** fails.
    If you successfully aim uninterupted for 1 minute, the attack auto hits.
    The target makes a Con save.
    On a success, they take half their max HP in damage, on a fail they are dropped to 0 HP.

* **Impossible Shot**

    Once per session, you may make an impossible shot with a rifle.
    The bullet can turn corners, cut a hangmans rope, ricochet off a galloping horse's steel shoe, or light a candle from a thousand yards.
    The shot auto hits.
    Roll damage as usual.
