I've never blogged before.
But it seems like everyone else playing around with the GLoG has a [GLoG-blog](https://diyanddragons.blogspot.com/2019/03/who-is-glogosphere.html), so I had to start one too.
Lack of original ideas be damned!
Hopefully I'll occasionally write something actually worth reading.
Maybe.
<!-- more -->

Probably not.

That's okay though.
Because sometimes it's about the process, not the product.
We play games because we enjoy the act of playing, not because something greater will come of it.

## Enough of that, how about something actually GLoG related?
How about a gunslinger class?
I've been working on a low magic fantasy western setting for when my current campaign ends.
And you can't have a western without outcasts that paint the wasteland red with death delivered from the barrel of a revolver.  Meet the Pistolero.

### PISTOLERO

A Pistolero starts with a rusty derringer, 25 small calibre bullets, a harmonica, and a woven poncho OR a bolero hat.

| A) | Quickdraw, Shot in the Back |
| B) | Fan the Hammer |
| C) | Pistol Expert, I'm Callin' You Out |
| D) | Reloading Trick, I Kill With My Heart |

* **Quickdraw**
    
    You get +1 to initiative checks for each Pistolero template you have.
    You lose this benefit if wielding any two handed weapon.

* **Shot in the Back**

    Any attack with a pistol against an enemy unaware of your presence,
    or anyone believing you to be an ally, is made at +4 and deals double damage if it hits.

* **Fan the Hammer**

    You may take up to a number of shots each round equal to the number of Pistolero templates you have.
    If the enemy is surprised, you may fire as many rounds as your pistol contains.

* **Pistol Expert**

    All damage dice you roll for pistols now explode.

* **I'm Callin' You Out**

    You stand in the middle of the street and hurl insults, mockeries, accusations, or derrisions at someone nearby.
    If the target can hear and understand you, they must make a Wis save or become offended and meet you outside to duel to the death.

* **Reloading Trick**

    Reloading your pistols no longer takes an action.

* **I Kill With My Heart**

    You no longer need line of sight to shoot at enemies.
    You are inherently aware of the presence of any creatures within 30 feet of yourself, and may shoot at them without penalty as long as any material between yourself and them could reasonably be penetrated by a bullet (wooden walls, thatch roofing, underbrush, etc.)

It's definitely still very WIP, but so far I think its a good start.
Fan the Hammer + Shot in the Back is pretty op,
but I feel like getting the drop on someone in a western should be devastating.
Next time I'll post the Pistoleros' counterpart - the Rifleman.
