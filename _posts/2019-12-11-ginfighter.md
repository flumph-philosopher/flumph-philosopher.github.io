### The Ginfighter

<!-- more -->

The Ginfighter starts with a hip flask (6 uses), a bottle opener, a dirty coat, and either a cudgel OR a rusty derringer.

| A) | Useless Sober, Whiskey Mastery, +2 skills |
| B) | Drinkin' Buddies, Drunken Boxing, +1 skill |
| C) | Feel No Pain, +1 skill |
| D) | Pickled Insides, +2 skills |

* **Useless Sober:**

    You lose access to the benefits of your Ginfighter templates while sober.
    Upon becoming sober, make a Con save or become **Hungover**.
    While hungover all checks are made at -4.
    A hangover can be cured by coffee and a greasy breakfast, hair of the dog, or will go away on it's own within 24 hours.

* **Whiskey Mastery:**

    You're only good at certain things while you're sauced.
    You may attempt to use a Whiskey Mastery skill by rolling equal or less than your current **Drunkenness Level** with a d6.
    Rolling equal causes your drunkenness to go down by 1.

* **Drinkin' Buddies**

    In any town large enough to have a saloon, you have a 50% chance of knowing someone you've drank with before.
    When you meet up with them make a charisma check.
    On a success they owe you a drink, and will provide 1d6 dollars worth of booze for you and the party.
    On a fail you owe them a drink, spend 1d6 dollars to settle the debt.
    Either way they will be happy to see you.
    They are useless in a fight, and won't get involved in the party's plans if they sound at all dangerous.
    They may, however, provide information about the town, rumors about the surrounding area, and a place for the party to lay low for the night.

* **Drunken Boxing:**

    You may add your current **Drunkenness Level**, up to your character level, to your damage rolls and defense.

* **Feel No Pain**

    Add your **Drunkenness Level** to your max HP.
    Drinking alcohol heals you for 1d6 minus drunkenness level.

* **Pickled Insides:**

    You are accustomed to being poisoned.
    All save-or-die poisons instead deal 1d8 damage to you on a failed save.
    All poisons that deal damage now only deal 1d4 to you.
    All special effect poisons have no effect on you.

## Drunkenness Level
This chart only applies to characters with at least one Ginfighter template.
Drunkenness will go down by one each hour no alcohol is consumed.
One drink per hour will maintain current drunkenness.
Each drink past the first will increase drunkenness by one.
The effects of each level also apply to all higher levels.

| Level | Effects |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **Tipsy:** You're feeling good. Any effects from being **Hungover** are cured. |
| 2 | **Loaded:** The alcohol steadies you to do what must be done. When making an attribute check, ignore any penalties caused by stressful or frightening circumstances. |
| 3 | **Soused:** Your inebriated state is plain for all to see. Whether this will improve or degrade a person's reaction to you will depend on the person in question. |
| 4 | **Sloshed:** Make a wisdom save every turn, or feel compelled to take another drink. Your companions are aware that this is a bad idea. You don't care. |
| 5 | **Smashed:** You are immune to Fear, Charm, and Psychic damage, but your Int and Wis each become a four until you become sober. |
| 6 | **Dead** |

## Whiskey Mastery Skills

| SKILL | WHAT HAPPENS ON A SUCCESS |
| --- | --- |
| **Angelic Voice** | Sing with a beauty and expressiveness that belies your boorish nature |
| **Artistic Soul** | Sketch, carve, paint or sculpt. The resulting work perfectly expresses the physical reality, experience, or emotional state that you want to convey. |
| **Babble** | Talk in circles to confuse or befuddle, only works on prudish or genteel folk |
| **Don't Mind Me** | Sit or lay on the ground in a public place and "act" like a passed out drunk. Most people will see you but ignore you. |
