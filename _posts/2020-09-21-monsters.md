The badlands of the La Vacio desert are a harsh and violent place, full of creatures that are better left alone than fought.

### CORRUPTED HOUND  

**NO. APPEARING:** 2d6  
**ARMOR CLASS:** *DAC 8 (AAC 12)*  
**MOVE:** *20 feet*  
**HIT DICE:** *1+1*  
**NO. OF ATTACKS:** *2*   
**DAMAGE/ATTACK:** *d6/d6*  
**SIZE:** *S*   
**MORALE:** 4  
**REACTION:** -6  

Once just a common hunting dog, exposure to a Blighted Artifact from the deep ruins has turned this unfortunate canine into a twisted monstrosity.
It's flesh is gnarled and deformed, teeth and eyes sprout from open sores, black ichor dripping from it's toothy maw.
A corrupted hound is driven mad with pain and fear, and will tend to lash out at anything not sharing it's corruption.

If a corrupted hound deals 10+ points of damage to a target in a single round, that target must save vs poison or contract the corruption.
If the corruption is not cured in one week, the target gains a mutation
(roll 1d600 in [The Metamorphica](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/115703/The-Metamorphica-Classic-Edition) twice and combine).
The target gains an additional mutation every week the corruption goes untreated from there on out.

### CHUPACABRA  

**NO. APPEARING:** 1d6  
**ARMOR CLASS:** *DAC 8 (AAC 12)*  
**MOVE:** *40 feet*  
**HIT DICE:** *2*  
**NO. OF ATTACKS:** *1*   
**DAMAGE/ATTACK:** *d6*  
**SPECIAL ATTACKS:** *Drain*   
**SIZE:** *S*   
**MORALE:** 6  
**REACTION:** -4  

The Chupacabra is a small bipedal lizard.
They are a nuisance to farmers, due to their feeding on livestock.
When the Chupacabra feeds, it latches on to its victim and drains them of their bodily fluids.
The remains of a Chupacabra attack are dried out and hollow.

**Drain** When the Chupacabra attacks an unsuspecting creature, it can choose to use its Drain.
The target saves vs paralysis.
On a fail the Chupacabra attaches to the victim and begins feeding on them.
That round, and each subsequent round the victim's Constitution is reduced by 1 and the Chupacabra's current and max HP increase by 2.
Once attached, the Chupacabra must be killed to detach them from the victim.

### SAND SIREN  

**NO. APPEARING:** 1  
**ARMOR CLASS:** *DAC 5 (AAC 15)*  
**MOVE:** *15 feet walking / 40 feet burrowing*  
**HIT DICE:** *12*  
**NO. OF ATTACKS:** *2*   
**DAMAGE/ATTACK:** *d10/d10*  
**SPECIAL ATTACKS:** *Enchanting Song*   
**SIZE:** *L (20+ feet long)*   
**MORALE:** 6  
**REACTION:** 0  

The Sand Siren is a large burrowing insectoid.
Much like an anglerfish, they have a lure appendage known as an esca which they use to draw in prey.
The Sand Siren's esca appears from a distance to be a humanoid female.

The Sand Siren buries itself in the sand with only the esca protruding from the surface.
It then imitates the sound of a crying woman to draw in prey.

**Enchanting Song** When the Sand Siren detects that a humanoid has approached, they begin singing their Enchanting Song.
All sentient creatures within earshot must save against magic or be charmed.
Charmed creatures will approach the Siren.

When a charmed creature comes within five feet of the siren, she will grab them and drag them under the sand to strangle and eat them.

### WORMEATEN BOAR  

**NO. APPEARING:** 1  
**ARMOR CLASS:** *DAC 4 (AAC 16)*  
**MOVE:** *40 feet*  
**HIT DICE:** *3*  
**NO. OF ATTACKS:** *1*   
**DAMAGE/ATTACK:** *d8*  
**SPECIAL ATTACKS:** *Charge*   
**SIZE:** *L*   
**MORALE:** 10  
**REACTION:** -4  

Wild boars that roam the Badlands are occasionally infected with a parasite known as the Tunneling Brain Worm.
The worm multiplies rapidly, taking over the hosts nervous system.
The worm colony induces the boar to leave its home territory and seek out a location near a water source.
The boar will die here, and the worms will use its body as an incubator for their eggs.
Once hatched, the new worms will move into the water, where they can infect other creatures that come to drink.

Infected boars will become increasingly aggressive as the infection progresses.

**Charge** The boar may forego its attack to perform a Charge, moving its full movement in a straight line.
While charging it may move through the space of any other creatures.
Creatures the boar moves through take 1d4 damage and are knocked prone.

### HULKING VINEGAROON  

**NO. APPEARING:** 1  
**ARMOR CLASS:** *DAC 6 (AAC 14)*  
**MOVE:** *40 feet*  
**HIT DICE:** *6+5*  
**NO. OF ATTACKS:** *3*   
**DAMAGE/ATTACK:** *d6/d6/d4*  
**SPECIAL ATTACKS:** *Spray Acid*   
**SIZE:** *L (10’ to 20’ long)*   
**MORALE:** 8  
**REACTION:** +4  

A distant relative of Giant Scorpions, Hulking Vinegaroons live in desert and mountain regions.
They nest in caverns and ravines during daylight and hunt at night.
Primarily preying on rodents, canids, and smaller livestock,
they are rarely aggressive towards humans unless they are starving or feel threatened.

In combat they can either attack with a claw/claw/bite or their Spray Acid attack.
If all three attacks of a claw/claw/bite successfully hit a single target, they are grappled and may make a strength check on their turn to escape.
Grappled enemies automatically fail their save if targeted by the Spray Acid attack

**Spray Acid** (15 ft stream, 6d4 damage, save for half).
Once used, Spray Acid can be used again in 1d4 rounds.
Creatures dropped to 0 hit points by the Spray Acid attack are dissolved and cannot be revived.
