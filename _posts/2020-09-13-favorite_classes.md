There are so many [GLOG classes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P4vVibmet_QzJH9IrmIRQaM-9QD5uv5dPbKLad21Ibo/edit?usp=sharing) out there.
Too many (not really).

So how do you know which ones are good?
Well most of them are pretty good actually, but that isn't very helpful.
So here are some of my favorites.
They're not necessarily the best, just some of the ones I like.

* [Really Good Dog](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxVHEMMjLlZ4Q1llSnJfWlB6bU0/view) by Arnold K.
  A classic from the early days of the GLOG.
  The "Best Friends" and "Lick" features do a great job of encouraging party bonding and roleplay.
  Also you get to be a doggo.
  A+ class.

* [Muscular Puncher](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2015/05/muscular-puncher.html) by Arnold K.
  If Alex Louise Armstrong were a GLOG Wizard.
  Nuff said.

* [The Crew](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/08/osr-glog-pirate-classes.html) by Skerples.
  Play as a swarm of unruly pirates.
  Drink rum, cause chaos, collectively act as one.
  Tons of fun.

* [Inventor Necromancer](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/05/osr-class-inventor-necromancer.html) by Skerples.
  Use the body parts of slain enemies to build weird devices.

* [The Butcher](https://crateredland.blogspot.com/2019/01/hello-long-time-reader-first-time-poster.html) by Lexi.
  Use the body parts of slain enemies to cook tasty meals that give you buffs.

* [The Bard](https://crateredland.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-bard.html) by Lexi.
  Become a metal musician that plays "Through the Fire and Flames" while your party punches a dragon to death.
  Then return to town, put on a show, and convince some groupies to follow you out to the dragon's lair and carry it's hoard back for you.
  D&D really is about making my 13yo self's dreams come true, isn't it?

* [The Jack](https://crateredland.blogspot.com/2019/03/the-jack-and-reaction-table.html) by Lexi.
  The core conceit of this class is that you have social connections you can exploit with almost everyone.
  Great for city campaigns.

* [Fungal Hive Colony](https://tarsostheorem.blogspot.com/2018/09/glog-class-fungal-hive-colony.html) by Saker Tarsos.
  Get infected with alien mushroom spores, and become the incubator of the next fungal supercolony.
  You get cool mushroom powers until you reach template D, then you go off like a mycological nuke.

There's my (incomplete, unordered) list. Why not post your own list of other people's GLOG classes that you like?
