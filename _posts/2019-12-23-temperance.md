With three classes done, I thought it was time to start looking at the setting where these cowboys will ply their trade.
I tried to load the town of Temperance with adventure hooks and opportunities for things to go sideways, but frankly I think it still needs another pass.
So here's the first draft of the town of Temperance.

<!-- more -->

Temperance is nestled amongst the buttes of the Rojo Desert.
A week's ride to the west is the Cracked Wastes and Cliffwall.
Ten days to the southeast is the port city Ibn Karth, situated on the Vashi river.
Eight days north is Badwater, and the sulphur swamp.
